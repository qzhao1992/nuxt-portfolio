# My Setup

A detailed look at the hardware and software I use to build projects. I prioritize a workspace that balances raw performance with a cozy, focused atmosphere.

## 💻 Workstation

My daily driver handles heavy multitasking and compilation without breaking a sweat.

- **Computer:** MacBook Pro (M4 Pro Chip, 24GB RAM).
- **Monitor:** LG UltraGear 32" – _The extra screen real estate is essential for having code and preview side-by-side._
- **Audio:** Google Pixel Buds Pro – _Great noise cancellation for deep work sessions._

## ⚡ Development Environment

I stay within my editor as much as possible to maintain flow.

- **Editor:** [Cursor](https://cursor.so/) (Dark Mode) – _The AI integration accelerates my coding speed significantly._
- **Terminal:** Integrated Cursor Terminal – _I prefer keeping my CLI tools right next to my code._
- **Formatting:** Prettier – _Configured to run on save for consistent code style._
- **Hosting:** Docker – _For consistent environments across dev and production._

## 📱 Productivity & Workflow

I keep my toolset simple and Google-centric to minimize friction.

- **Browser:** Google Chrome.
- **Planning:** Google Calendar – _I use this for everything: meetings, daily schedule, and to-do blocks._

## 🕯️ The "Cozy" Desk

My physical environment is designed for comfort and focus, especially during long coding sessions.

- **Desk:** Solid Redwood Desk – _Natural wood adds a warm tone to the setup._
- **Seating:** Vintage Church Chair – _Solid, upright support._
- **Lighting:** Monitor Light Bar – _Reduces eye strain during late-night commits._
- **Atmosphere:** Candle Warmer Light – _For scent and ambiance without an open flame._
- **Climate:** Amazon Space Heater – _Essential for keeping the under-desk area warm._
